# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `npx cdk deploy`  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `npx cdk diff`    compare deployed stack with current state
* `npx cdk synth`   emits the synthesized CloudFormation template


### Data Strategy for Gen AI Knowledge Bases

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Gen AI, 
the foundation of a successful AI-driven solution is robust and well-structured data. 
A comprehensive data strategy is critical for enabling enterprises to harness the full potential of Gen AI, 
allowing for efficient, scalable, and accurate knowledge extraction and application. 
Below is a streamlined approach using AWS CDK to set up and manage a multi modal data pipeline, 
which is essential for building a Gen AI knowledge base. 
The strategy focuses on ensuring seamless data ingestion, processing, and converting  the multi modal data 
(power point presentations with images and screen shots, excel sheets, word documents, transcriptions (mp4 files) , pdf files ) ,  
it into a standard text format, ultimately creating a solid foundation for ingestion of data into the Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

#### Key Objectives

1. **Data Ingestion and Organization:**
   Establishing a reliable and scalable method to ingest various types of raw data, including transcripts, PowerPoint presentations, and PDF files, into the system.

2. **Automated ETL Processing:**
   Leveraging event-driven architectures to automate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. This ensures that data is consistently and accurately transformed into a format suitable for AI processing.

3. **Efficient Indexing and Storage:**
   Organizing the processed data into a structured format that can be easily indexed and queried by AI models, enabling quick and relevant knowledge retrieval.

4. **Expandability and Maintenance:**
   Designing a system that can scale with the growing data needs of the enterprise while maintaining simplicity in deployment and management.

#### Solution Overview

Using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), we propose a robust infrastructure that automates the ingestion and processing of raw data, facilitating the creation of a Gen AI knowledge base. This approach integrates AWS services such as S3, Lambda, and Service Catalog, ensuring a seamless flow from data ingestion to knowledge extraction.

1. **Setting Up AWS Organizations and Service Catalog:**
   Utilize AWS Organizations to manage multiple accounts and AWS Service Catalog to share pre-configured Bedrock templates across child accounts. This ensures consistency and adherence to best practices across the organization.

2. **Data Ingestion with S3:**
   Create dedicated S3 buckets in each child account to serve as repositories for raw data files. These buckets will act as the entry point for the data pipeline.

3. **Event-Driven ETL Processing:**
   Deploy AWS Lambda functions using CDK to handle the ETL process. These functions are triggered by S3 events, ensuring that each new file uploaded to the bucket is processed in real-time. The ETL logic is customized for different file types (transcripts, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs) to extract meaningful text and metadata.

4. **Structured Data Storage:**
   Store the processed data in a structured format that facilitates easy indexing and querying. This could involve storing the extracted text in another S3 bucket or indexing it directly into a database such as Amazon DynamoDB or a graph database like Neo4j.

5. **Expandability, Scalability and Automation:**
   Leverage the infrastructure-as-code capabilities of CDK to automate the deployment and scaling of the data pipeline. This ensures that as the volume of raw data grows, the system can scale accordingly without manual intervention.

#### Conclusion

By implementing this data strategy, enterprises can lay a strong foundation for building Gen AI knowledge bases. 
This approach ensures that raw data is efficiently ingested, accurately processed, and effectively indexed, 
providing the necessary groundwork for advanced AI applications. 
With a focus on automation, scalability, and maintainability, this strategy enables 
organizations to unlock the full potential of Gen AI, driving innovation and insights across various domains.
